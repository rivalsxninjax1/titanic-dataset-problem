# Titanic Dataset EDA Project

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights regarding passenger demographics and survival patterns. The analysis includes data cleaning, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations to better understand the factors influencing survival rates.

## Overview

The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset.
- Perform detailed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.
- Generate visualizations to explore relationships between key features (e.g., age, fare, gender) and survival outcomes.
- Summarize insights which can provide context for further statistical or predictive analysis.

## Dataset

The analysis uses the Titanic dataset, which can be accessed via [Seaborn's built-in datasets](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). The dataset contains information on the passengers including:
- **Survived:** Survival status (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **Pclass:** Ticket class
- **Sex:** Gender
- **Age:** Age of the passenger
- **Fare:** Ticket fare
- Other columns such as embarkation port, etc.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed (3.7 or higher recommended). Then, install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn certifi
